Hello {KEY-NAME},

A xoops.org client from {IP} has just requested a new xoopsauth key for our API and generated one for storage in the module in the system control panel on xoops the popular portal for resourcing in Modules, Themes as well as the Core.

The following API's will require the xoopskey as the key or under MD5/SHA1 Checksums; and they are currently:~

{APIS}

Your xoopskey is as follows: {KEY}! That means on all the API calls for writing or retrieving except jumps, you need to include at the end of each call the following examples:

 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={KEY}
 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={MD5KEY}
 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={SHA1KEY}

It was generated by {NAME} ({UNAME}) for:

   Title: 		{KEY-TITLE}
   Name: 		{KEY-NAME}
   Company: 	{KEY-COMPANY}
   eMail: 		{KEY-EMAIL}
   URL: 		{KEY-URL}
   Key: 		{KEY}

Is the API Limited: {LIMITED}
