Hello {KEY-NAME},

Your website originally registering with the key: {KEY} for the XOOPS REST API on it subdomain has run out due too the API's being limited to polling token calls has run out of {PERIODICALLY} polling tokens!

That means on all the API calls for writing or retrieving except jumps, you need to include at the end of each call the following examples:

 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={KEY}
 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={MD5KEY}
 * https://?????.xoops.org/v1/function/json.api?xoopskey={SHA1KEY}

There is a total limit on this key for {PERIODICALLY} basis of: {LIMITPOLLS} calls to all the API's available, you can purchase for an: {PERIODICAL} x 1 the additional polling calls of all REST API's of the number of polls totaling: {PURCHASEPOLLS} for {PURCHASEAMOUNT} {PURCHASENOMIAL} as a once off flat fee; use the following URL:~ {PURCHASEURL} to do this!

It was generated by {NAME} ({UNAME}) for:

   Title: 		{KEY-TITLE}
   Name: 		{KEY-NAME}
   Company: 	{KEY-COMPANY}
   eMail: 		{KEY-EMAIL}
